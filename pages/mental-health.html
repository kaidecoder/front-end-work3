            Genetic factors — having a close family member with a mental illness
            can increase the chance that you might get a mental illness.
            However, just because one family member has a mental illness doesn't
            mean that others will.

            financial or work problems can impact on mental health. Traumatic
            experiences such as living in a war zone can increase the risk of
